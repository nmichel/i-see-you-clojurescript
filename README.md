=======================

Implementation of a 2D visibility determination algorithm in clojurescript

See a demo : at http://nmichel.github.io/i-see-you-clojurescript/

Getting started
===============

1) Modify project.clj, especially figwheel related parameters, to match your very own network configuration

2) Start interactive session using leiningen and figwheel plugin

$ lein figwheel

3) open file index.html in a browser

URL must look like file://.../i-see-you-clojurescript.git/index.html

A prompt should appear in the command line where you opened the interactive session in step 2, allowing you to interact with the browser in clojurescript.
